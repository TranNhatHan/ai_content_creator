# Philosophy of language

## Semiotics

BEFORE

c.400 BCE Plato explores the relationship between names and things.

c.250 BCE Stoic philosophers develop an early theory of linguistic signs.

1632 Portuguese philosopher John Poinsot writes his Treatise on Signs.

AFTER

1950s Saussure’s analysis of the structures of language influences Noam Chomsky’s theory of generative grammar, which aims to expose the rules of a language that govern its possible word combinations.

1960s Roland Barthes explores the literary implications of signs and semiotics.

Saussure was a 19th-century Swiss philosopher who saw language as made up of systems of “signs”, with the signs acting as the basic units of the language. His studies formed the basis of a new theory, known as semiotics. This new theory of signs was developed by other philosophers during the 20th century such as Russia’s Roman Jakobson, who summed up the semiotic approach when he said that “every message is made of signs.”

Saussure said that a sign is made up of two things. Firstly, a “signifier”, which is a sound-image. This is not the actual sound, but the mental “image” we have of the sound. Secondly, the “signified”, or concept. Here Saussure turns his back on a long tradition that says language is about the relationships between words and things, because he is saying that both aspects of a sign are mental (our concept of a “dog” for example, and a sound-image of the sound “dog”). Saussure claims that any message—for example “my dog is called Fred”—is a system of signs. This means that it is a system of relationships between sound-images and concepts. However, Saussure states that the relationship between the signified and the signifier is arbitrary—so there is nothing particularly “doggy” about the sound “dog”, which is why the word can be chien in French, or gou in Chinese.

Saussure’s work on language became the basis of modern linguistics, and influenced many philosophers and literary theorists.

"In the lives of individuals and of societies, language is a factor of greater importance than any other."

Ferdinand de Saussure

## Logic

BEFORE

4th century BCE Aristotle sets the foundations of logic.

Late 19th century Gottlob Frege develops the foundations of modern logic.

Early 20th century Bertrand Russell develops notation that translates natural language into logical propositions.

AFTER

1920s Ideas in the Tractatus are used by philosophers of the Vienna Circle, such as Moritz Schlick and Rudolf Carnap, to develop Logical Positivism.

From 1930 Wittgenstein rejects the ideas expressed in the Tractatus, and begins to explore very different ways of viewing language.

Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus is perhaps one of the most forbidding texts in the history of 20th-century philosophy. Only around 70 pages long in its English translation, the book is made up of a series of highly condensed and technical numbered remarks.

In order to appreciate the full significance of the Tractatus, it is important to set it within its philosophical context. The fact that Wittgenstein is talking about the “limits” of my language and my world sets him firmly within the philosophical tradition that stems from the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. In The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant set out to explore the limits of knowledge by posing questions such as “What can I know?” and “What things will lie forever outside of human understanding?” One reason that Kant asked such questions was that he believed many problems in philosophy arose because we fail to recognize the limitations of human understanding. By turning our attention back onto ourselves and asking about the necessary limits of our knowledge, we can then either resolve, or even perhaps dissolve, nearly all of the philosophical problems of the past.

The Tractatus tackles the same kind of task that Kant did, but does so in a far more radical fashion. Wittgenstein states that he is setting out to make clear what can be meaningfully said. In much the same way that Kant strives to set the limits of reason, Wittgenstein wants to set the limits of language and, by implication, of all thought. He does this because he suspects that a great deal of philosophical discussion and disagreement is based on some fundamental errors in how we go about thinking and talking about the world.

"The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of the problem."

Ludwig Wittgenstein

Logical structure

For all of their apparent complexity, Wittgenstein’s central ideas in the Tractatus are essentially based on a fairly simple principle, that both language and the world are formally structured, and that these structures can be broken down into their component parts. Wittgenstein attempts to lay bare the structures both of the world and of language, and then to show the way they relate to each other. Having done this, he attempts to draw a number of wide-reaching philosophical conclusions.

If we are to understand what Wittgenstein means when he says that limits of my language are the limits of my world, we need to ask what he means by the words “world” and “language”, because he does not use these words in the everyday sense we might expect. When he talks about language, the debt Wittgenstein owes to the British philosopher Bertrand Russell becomes apparent. For Russell, who was an important figure in the development of philosophical logic, everyday language was inadequate for talking clearly and precisely about the world. He believed that logic was a “perfect language”, which excluded all traces of ambiguity, so he developed a way of translating everyday language into what he considered a logical form.

Logic is concerned with what are known in philosophy as propositions. We can think of propositions as assertions that it is possible for us to consider as being either true or false. For example, the statement “the elephant is very angry” is a proposition, but the word “elephant” is not. According to Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, meaningful language must consist solely of propositions. “The totality of propositions,” he writes, “is language.”

Knowing a little about what Wittgenstein means by language, we can now explore what he means by “the world.” The Tractatus begins with the claim that “the world is all that is the case.” This might appear to be straightforward and robustly matter-of-fact, but taken on its own, it is not entirely clear what Wittgenstein means by this statement. He goes on to write that “the world is the totality of facts, not of things.” Here we can see a parallel between the way that Wittgenstein treats language and the way he is treating the world. It may be a fact, for example, that the elephant is angry, or that there is an elephant in the room, but an elephant just by itself is not a fact.

From this point, it begins to become clear how the structure of language and that of the world might be related. Wittgenstein says that language “pictures” the world. He formulated this idea during World War I, when he read in a newspaper about a court case in Paris. The case concerned a car accident, and the events were re-enacted for those present in court using model cars and model pedestrians to represent the cars and pedestrians in the real world. The model cars and the model pedestrians were able to depict their counterparts, because they were related to each other in exactly the same way as the real cars and real pedestrians involved in the accident. Similarly, all the elements depicted on a map are related to each other in exactly the same way as they are in the landscape that the map represents. What a picture shares with that which it is depicting, Wittgenstein says, is a logical form.

It is important here to realize that we are talking about logical pictures, and not about visual pictures. Wittgenstein presents a useful example to show what he means. The sound waves generated by a performance of a symphony, the score of that symphony, and the pattern formed by the grooves on a gramophone recording of the symphony all share between them the same logical form. Wittgenstein states, “A picture is laid against reality like a measure.” In this way it can depict the world.

Of course, our picture may be incorrect. It may not agree with reality, for example, by appearing to show that the elephant is not angry when the elephant is, in fact, very angry. There is no middle ground here for Wittgenstein. Because he starts with propositions that are, by their very nature, true or false, pictures also are either true or false.

Language and the world, then, both have a logical form; and language can speak about the world by picturing the world, and picturing it in a fashion that agrees with reality. It is at this point that Wittgenstein’s idea gets really interesting, and it is here that we can see why Wittgenstein is interested in the limits of language.

Consider the following idea: “You should give half of your salary to charity.” This is not picturing anything in the world in the sense meant by Wittgenstein. What can be said—what Wittgenstein calls the “totality of true propositions”—is merely the sum of all those things that are the case, or the natural sciences.

Discussion about religious and ethical values is, for Wittgenstein, strictly meaningless. Because the things that we are attempting to talk about when we discuss such topics are beyond the limits of the world, they also lie beyond the limits of our language. Wittgenstein writes, “It is clear that ethics cannot be put into language.”

The ancient Egyptians arranged symbols and stylized images of objects in the world, known as hieroglyphs, into logically structured sequences to create a form of written language.

A digital image, although not the same sort of object as the one it depicts, has the same “logical form.” Words only represent reality for Wittgenstein if, again, both have the same logical form.

"Logic is not a body of doctrine but a mirror-image of the world."

Ludwig Wittgenstein

Beyond words

Some readers of Wittgenstein, at this point, claim that he is a champion of the sciences, driving out vague concepts involved in talk of ethics, religion, and the like. But something more complex is going on. Wittgenstein does not think that the “problems of life” are nonsensical. Instead, he believes that these are the most important problems of all. It is simply that they cannot be put into words, and because of this, they cannot become a part of philosophy. Wittgenstein writes that these things, even though we cannot speak of them, nevertheless make themselves manifest, adding that “they are what is mystical.”

All of this, however, has serious repercussions for the propositions that lie within the Tractatus itself. After all, these are not propositions that picture the world. Even logic, one of Wittgenstein’s major tools, does not say anything about the world. Is the Tractatus, therefore, nonsense? Wittgenstein himself was fearless in following his argument to its conclusion, ultimately recognizing that the answer to such a question must be yes. Anybody who understands the Tractatus properly, he claims, will eventually see that the propositions used in it are nonsense, too. They are like the steps of a philosophical ladder that helps us to climb altogether beyond the problems of philosophy, but which we can kick away once we have ascended.

"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence."

Ludwig Wittgenstein

Philosophy demands logical, unambiguous language. Wittgenstein concludes, therefore, that it can only be made up of propositions, or statements of fact, such as “the cat sat on the mat”, which can be clearly divided into their component parts.

Change of direction

After completing the Tractatus, Wittgenstein concluded that there were no more philosophical problems left to resolve, and so abandoned the discipline. However, over the course of the 1920s and 1930s, he began to question his earlier thinking, becoming one of its fiercest critics. In particular, he questioned his once firmly held belief that language consists solely of propositions, a view that ignores much of what we do in our everyday speech—from telling jokes, to cajoling, to scolding.

Nevertheless, despite all of its problems, the Tractatus remains one of the most challenging and compelling works of Western philosophy—and ultimately one of the most mysterious.

LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN

Born into a wealthy Viennese family in 1889, Wittgenstein first studied engineering and in 1908 traveled to England to continue his education in Manchester. However, he soon developed an interest in logic, and by 1911 had moved to Cambridge to study under the philosopher Bertrand Russell.

During World War I, he served on the Russian front and in Italy, where he was taken prisoner. Around this time, he began the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which was published in 1921.

Believing that the Tractatus resolved all the problems of philosophy, Wittgenstein now embarked on an itinerant career as a schoolteacher, gardener, and architect. But after developing criticisms of his earlier ideas, he resumed his work at Cambridge in 1929, becoming a professor there in 1939. He died in 1951.

## Analytic philosophy

BEFORE

c.400 BCE Plato’s Cratylus investigates the relationship between words and things.

19th century Søren Kierkegaard stresses the importance of the study of language for philosophy.

1950s Ludwig Wittgenstein writes that there is no such thing as a private language.

AFTER

1980s Richard Rorty suggests that knowledge is more like “conversation” than the representation of reality.

1990s In Consciousness Explained, Quine’s former student Daniel Dennett says that both meaning and inner experience can only be understood as social acts.

Some philosophers assert that language is about the relationship between words and things. Quine, however, disagrees. Language is not about the relationship between objects and verbal signifiers, but about knowing what to say and when to say it. It is, he says in his 1968 essay Ontological Relativity, a social art.

Quine suggests the following thought experiment. Imagine that we come across some people—perhaps natives of another country—who speak a language we do not share. We are sitting with a group of these people when a rabbit appears, and one of the natives says “gavagai.” We wonder if there can be a connection between the event—the appearance of the rabbit—and the fact that the native says “gavagai.” As time goes on, we note that every time a rabbit appears, somebody says “gavagai”, so we conclude that “gavagai” can be reliably translated as rabbit. But, Quine insists, we are wrong. “Gavagai” could mean all manner of things. It could mean “oh, look, dinner!” for example, or it could mean “behold, a fluffy creature!”

If we wanted to determine the meaning of “gavagai”, we could try another method. We could point to other fluffy creatures (or other things on the dinner menu) and see if our utterance of “gavagai” met with assent or dissent. But even if we were to reach a position where, in each and every occasion on which “gavagai” was uttered, we ourselves would utter the word “rabbit”, we still could not be sure that this was an appropriate translation. “Gavagai” could mean “set of rabbit parts” or “wood-living rabbit” or “rabbit or hare”; it might even refer to a short prayer that must be uttered whenever a rabbit is seen.

Unsettled language

In attempting to establish the precise meaning of this mysterious “gavagai”, therefore, we might think that the solution would be to learn the language of our informants thoroughly, so that we could be absolutely sure of the contexts in which the word was spoken. But this would only result in multiplying the problem, because we could not be sure that the other words we found ourselves using to explain the meaning of “gavagai” were themselves accurate translations.

Quine refers to this problem as the “indeterminacy of translation”, and it has unsettling implications. It suggests that ultimately words do not have meanings. The sense of somebody uttering “gavagai” (or, for that matter, “rabbit”), and of this utterance being meaningful comes not from some mysterious link between words and things, but from the patterns of our behavior, and the fact that we have learned to participate in language as a social art.

No word has a fixed meaning, according to Quine. When the word “rabbit” is spoken, it may mean any one of a number of things, depending on the context in which it is said.

WILLARD VAN ORMAN QUINE

Born in 1908 in Ohio, USA, Quine studied at Harvard with Alfred North Whitehead, a philosopher of logic and mathematics. While there he also met Bertrand Russell, who was to become a profound influence on his thought. After completing his PhD in 1932, Quine traveled throughout Europe, meeting many of its most eminent philosophers, including several of the Vienna Circle.

Returning to teach at Harvard, Quine’s philosophical career was briefly interrupted during World War II when he spent four years decrypting messages for the US Navy intelligence. A great traveler, he was said to be prouder of the fact that he had visited 118 countries than of his many awards and fellowships. Quine became professor of philosophy at Harvard in 1956, and taught there until his death in 2000, aged 92.

## Semiotics

BEFORE

380 BCE Plato’s Symposium is the first sustained philosophical discussion of love in the West.

4th century CE St Augustine of Hippo writes extensively on the nature of love.

1916 Ferdinand de Saussure’s Course in General Linguistics establishes modern semiotics and the study of language as a series of signs.

1966 French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan looks at the relationship between Alcibiades, Socrates, and Agathon in his Écrits.

AFTER

1990s Julia Kristeva explores the relationship between love, semiotics, and psychoanalysis.

T he strangest, but most popular, book written by philosopher and literary critic Roland Barthes is A Lover’s Discourse. As the French title, Fragments d’un discours amoureux, suggests, this is a book told in fragments and snapshots, somewhat like the essay One-Way Street by the German philosopher Walter Benjamin. A Lover’s Discourse is not so much a book of philosophy as it is a love story; but it is a love story without any real story. There are no characters, and there is nothing in the way of a plot. There are only the reflections of a lover in what Barthes calls “extreme solitude.”

At the very beginning of the book, Barthes makes clear that a plot is not possible, because the solitary thoughts of a lover come in outbursts that are often contradictory and lack any clear order. As a lover, Barthes suggests, I might even find myself plotting against myself. The lover is somebody who might be affectionately described as having “lost the plot.” So instead of using a plot, or narrative, Barthes arranges his book like an extraordinary encyclopaedia of contradictory and disordered outbursts, any of which might serve as the point the reader might suddenly exclaim, “That’s so true! I recognize that scene…”

The language of love

It is in this context that Barthes suggests “language is a skin.” Language, at least the language of the lover, is not something that simply talks about the world in a neutral fashion, but it is something that, as Barthes says, “trembles with desire.” Barthes writes of how “I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words.” Even if I write cool, detached philosophy about love, Barthes claims, there is buried in my philosophical coolness a secret address to a particular person, an object of my desire, even if this somebody is “a phantom or a creature still to come.”

Barthes gives an example of this secret address (although not, it should be said, in the context of a particularly detached philosophical discussion) from Plato’s dialogue, The Symposium. This is an account of a discussion on the subject of love that takes place in the house of the poet Agathon. A statesman called Alcibiades turns up to the discussion both late and drunk, and sits down on a couch with Agathon and the philosopher Socrates. The drunken speech he gives is full of praise for Socrates, but it is Agathon that Alcibiades desires; it is against Agathon, so to speak, that Alcibiades’ language is rubbing.

But what of the language that we use when talking of other things? Is only the lover’s language a skin that trembles with hidden desire, or is this also true of other types of language? Barthes does not tell us, leaving us to consider the idea for ourselves.

"Every lover is mad."

Roland Barthes

The lover’s language is like a skin, says Barthes, which is inhabits by the lover. Its words are able to move the beloved—and only the beloved—in an almost physical or tactile way.

ROLAND BARTHES

Barthes was born in Cherbourg, France, in 1915. He attended the University of Sorbonne in Paris from 1935, graduating in 1939, but by this time he had already contracted the tuberculosis that would afflict him for the remainder of his life. His illness made it difficult to acquire teaching qualifications, but it exempted him from military service during World War II. After the war, having finally qualified as a teacher, he taught in France, Romania, and Egypt. He returned to live in France full time in 1952, and there started to write the pieces that were collected together and published under the title Mythologies in 1957.

Barthes’ reputation grew steadily through the 1960s, in France and internationally, and he taught both at home and abroad. He died at the age of 64, when he was run over by a laundry van after lunching with President Mitterrand.
