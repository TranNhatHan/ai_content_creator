## Social contract theory

BEFORE

1651 Thomas Hobbes puts forward the idea of a social contract in his book Leviathan.

1689 John Locke’s Two Treatises of Government asserts a human’s natural right to defend “life, health, liberty, or possessions.”

AFTER

1791 Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man argues that government’s only purpose is to safeguard the rights of the individual.

1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels publish The Communist Manifesto.

1971 John Rawls develops the idea of “Justice as Fairness” in his book A Theory of Justice.

Rousseau was very much a product of the mid- to late- 18th-century period known as the Enlightenment, and an embodiment of the continental European philosophy of the time. As a young man he tried to make his name as both a musician and composer, but in 1740 he met Denis Diderot and Jean d’Alembert, the philosopher compilers of the new Encyclopédie, and became interested in philosophy. The political mood in France at this time was uneasy. Enlightenment thinkers in France and England had begun to question the status quo, undermining the authority of both the Church and the aristocracy, and advocates of social reform such as Voltaire continually fell foul of the overbearing censorship of the establishment. Unsurprisingly in this context, Rousseau’s main area of interest became political philosophy. His thinking was influenced not only by his French contemporaries, but also by the work of English philosophers—and in particular the idea of a social contract as proposed by Thomas Hobbes and refined by John Locke.

Like them, Rousseau compared an idea of humanity in a hypothetical “natural state” with how people actually live in a civil society. But he took such a radically different view of this natural state and the way it is affected by society, that it could be considered a form of “counter-Enlightenment” thinking. It held within it the seeds of the next great movement, Romanticism.

Science and art corrupt

Hobbes had envisaged life in the natural state as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” In his view humanity is instinctively self-interested and self-serving, and that civilization is necessary to place restrictions on these instincts. Rousseau, however, looks more kindly on human nature, and sees civil society as a much less benevolent force.

The idea that society might be a harmful influence first occurred to Rousseau when he wrote an essay for a competition organized by the Academy of Dijon, answering the question: “Has the restoration of the sciences and the arts contributed to refining moral practices?” The expected answer from thinkers of the time, and especially from a musician such as Rousseau, was an enthusiastic affirmative, but in fact Rousseau argued the opposite case. His Discourse on the Sciences and Arts, which won him first prize, controversially puts forward the idea that the arts and sciences corrupt and erode morals. He argues that far from improving minds and lives, the arts and sciences decrease human virtue and happiness.

The Romantic movement in art and literature that dominated the late 18th and early 19th centuries reflected Rousseau’s vision of the state of nature as one of beauty, innocence, and virtue.

The inequality of laws

Having broken with established thinking in his prize-winning and publicly acclaimed essay, Rousseau took the idea a stage further in a second essay, the Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men. The subject matter chimed with the mood of the time, echoing the calls for social reform from writers such as Voltaire, but once again Rousseau contradicted conventional thinking with his analysis. The selfish, savage, and unjust state of nature depicted by Hobbes is, for Rousseau, a description not of “natural man”, but of “civilized man.” In fact he claims that it is civil society that induces this savage state. Humanity’s natural state, he argues, is innocent, happy, and independent: man is born free.

Society corrupts

The state of nature that Rousseau describes is a pastoral idyll, where people in their natural state are fundamentally good. (The English wrongly interpreted Rousseau’s idea of natural man as a “noble savage”, but this was due to a mistranslation of the French sauvage, which means simply “natural”, not brutish.) People are endowed with innate virtue and, more importantly, the attributes of compassion and empathy. But once this state of innocence is disrupted, and the power of reason begins to separate humankind from the rest of nature, people become detached from their natural virtues. The imposition of civil society on the state of nature therefore entails a move away from virtue toward vice, and from idyllic happiness toward misery.

Rousseau sees the fall from a state of nature and the establishment of civil society as regrettable but inevitable, because it resulted from the human capacity for reason. The process began, he thought, the first time that a man enclosed a piece of land for himself, so introducing the notion of property. As groups of people began to live side by side like this, they formed societies, which could only be maintained though a system of laws. But Rousseau claims that every society loses touch with humanity’s natural virtues, including empathy, and so imposes laws that are not just, but selfish. They are designed to protect property, and they are inflicted on the poor by the rich. The move from a natural to a civilized state therefore brought about a move not only from virtue to vice, Rousseau points out, but also from innocence and freedom to injustice and enslavement. Although humanity is naturally virtuous, it is corrupted by society; and although man is born free, the laws imposed by society condemn him to a life “in chains.”

Adam and Eve represent the kind of perfect “natural” humans that Rousseau thought predated society. He said that we, like them, are corrupted by knowledge, becoming ever more selfish and unhappy.

The Social Contract

Rousseau’s second Discourse ruffled even more feathers than his first, but it gained him a reputation and quite a following. His portrayal of the state of nature as desirable and not brutal formed a vital part of the emerging Romantic movement in literature. Rousseau’s rallying cry of “back to nature!” and his pessimistic analysis of modern society as full of inequalities and injustices sat well with the growing social unrest of the 1750s, especially in France. Not content with merely stating the problem, Rousseau went on to offer a solution, in what is seen as perhaps his most influential work, The Social Contract.

Rousseau opens his book with the challenging declaration “Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains”, which was considered such a call for radical change that it was adopted as a slogan during the French Revolution 27 years later. Having issued his challenge, Rousseau then sets out his vision of an alternative civil society, run not by aristocrats, the monarchy, and the Church, but by all citizens, who participate in the business of legislation. Modelled on Classical republican ideas of democracy, Rousseau imagines the citizen body operating as a unit, prescribing laws according to the volonté générale, or general will. The laws would arise from all and apply to all—everyone would be considered equal. In contrast with the social contract envisaged by Locke, which was designed to protect the rights and property of individuals, Rousseau advocates giving legislative power to the people as a whole, for the benefit of all, administered by the general will. He believes that the freedom to take part in the legislative process would lead to an elimination of inequality and injustice, and that it would promote a feeling of belonging to society—that it would inevitably lead to the liberté, égalité, fraternité (liberty, equality, fraternity) that became the motto of the new French Republic.

"Tranquility is found also in dungeons; but is that enough to make them desirable places to live in?"

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

The evils of education

In another book written in the same year, entitled Emile, or On Education, Rousseau expanded on his theme, explaining that education was responsible for corrupting the state of nature and perpetuating the evils of modern society. In other books and essays he concentrated on the adverse effects of both conventional religion and atheism. At the center of all his works lay the idea that reason threatens human innocence and, in turn, freedom and happiness. Instead of the education of the intellect, he proposes an education of the senses, and he suggests that our religious faith should be guided by the heart, not the head.

"The general will should come from all to apply to all."

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Political influence

Most of Rousseau’s writings were immediately banned in France, gaining him both notoriety and a large following. By the time of his death in 1778, revolution in France and elsewhere was imminent, and his idea of a social contract in which the general will of the citizen body controlled the legislative process offered the revolutionaries a viable alternative to the corrupt system as it stood. But his philosophy was at odds with contemporary thinking, and his insistence that a state of nature was superior to civilization led him to fall out with fellow reformers such as Voltaire and Hume. Rousseau’s political influence was felt most strongly during the period of revolution immediately after his death, but his influence on philosophy, and political philosophy in particular, emerged to a greater extent in the 19th century. Georg Hegel integrated Rousseau’s ideas of social contract into his own philosophical system. Later and more importantly, Karl Marx was particularly struck by some of Rousseau’s work on inequality and injustice. Unlike Robespierre, one of the leaders of the French Revolution, who had appropriated Rousseau’s philosophy for his own ends during the Reign of Terror, Marx fully understood and developed Rousseau’s analysis of capitalist society and the revolutionary means of replacing it. Marx’s Communist Manifesto ends with a nod to Rousseau, encouraging the proletarians (workers) have “nothing to lose but their chains.”

The French Revolution, which began 11 years after Rousseau’s death, was inspired by his claim that it was unjust for the rich few to rule over the effectively voiceless, powerless poor.

JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU

Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born to a Calvinist family in Geneva. His mother died only a few days after his birth, and his father fled home following a duel a few years later, leaving him in the care of an uncle.

Aged 16, he left for France and converted to Catholicism. While trying to make his name as a composer, he worked as a civil servant and was posted to Venice for two years, but on his return he began to write philosophy. His controversial views led to his books being banned in Switzerland and France, and warrants being issued for his arrest. He was forced to accept David Hume’s invitation to live in England for a short time, but after they quarrelled he returned to France under a false name. He was later allowed to return to Paris, where he lived until his death at the age of 66.

## Classical economics

BEFORE

c.350 BCE Aristotle emphasizes the importance of domestic production (“economy”) and explains the role of money.

Early 1700s Dutch thinker Bernard Mandeville argues that selfish actions can lead indirectly to socially desirable consequences.

AFTER

1850s British writer John Ruskin argues that Smith’s views are too materialistic and therefore anti-Christian.

1940s onward Philosophers apply the idea of bargaining throughout the social sciences as a model for explaining human behavior.

Scottish writer Adam Smith is often considered the most important economist the world has ever known. The concepts of bargaining and self-interest that he explored, and the possibility of different types of agreements and interests—such as “the common interest”—are of recurring appeal to philosophers. His writings are also important because they give a more general and abstract form to the idea of the “commercial” society that was developed by his friend David Hume.

Like his Swiss contemporary, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Smith assumes that the motives of human beings are partly benevolent and partly self-interested, but that self-interest is the stronger trait and so is a better guide to human behavior. He believes that this can be confirmed by social observation, and so, broadly speaking, his approach is an empirical one. In one of his most famous discussions of the psychology of bargaining, he contends that the most frequent opening gambit in a bargain is for one party to urge the other—“the best way for you to get what you want is for you to give me what I want.” In other words, “we address ourselves, not to [another’s] humanity, but to their self-love.”

Smith goes on to claim that the exchange of useful objects is a distinctively human characteristic. He notes that dogs are never observed exchanging bones, and that should an animal wish to obtain something, the only way it can do so is to “gain the favor of those whose service it requires.” Humans may also depend on this sort of “fawning or servile attention”, but they cannot resort to it whenever they need help, because life requires “the cooperation and assistance of great multitudes.” For example, to stay comfortably at an inn for a night we require the input of many people—to cook and serve the food, to prepare the room and so on—none of whose services can be depended on through good will alone. For this reason, “man is an animal that makes bargains”—and the bargain is struck by proposing a deal that appears to be in the self-interest of both parties.

The division of labor

In his account of the emergence of market economies, Smith argues that our ability to make bargains put an end to the once universal requirement that every person, or at least every family, be economically self-sufficient. Thanks to bargaining, it became possible for us to concentrate on producing fewer and fewer goods, and ultimately to produce just a single good, or offer a single service, and to exchange this for everything else we required. This process was revolutionized by the invention of money, which abolished the need to barter. From then on, in Smith’s view, only those who were unable to work had to depend on charity.

Everyone else could come to the marketplace to exchange their labor—or the money they earned through labor—for the products of other people’s labor.

This elimination of the need to provide everything for ourselves led to the emergence of people with particular sets of skills (such as the baker and the carpenter), and then to what Smith calls a “division of labor” among workers. This is Smith’s phrase for specialization, whereby an individual not only pursues a single type of work, but performs only a single task in a job that is shared by several people. Smith illustrates the importance of specialization at the beginning of his masterpiece, The Wealth of Nations, by showing how the making of a humble metal pin is radically improved by adopting the factory system. Where one man working alone would find it hard to produce 20 perfect pins in a day, a group of 10 men, charged with different tasks—from drawing out the wire, straightening it, cutting it, pointing it, and grinding it, to joining it to a pinhead—were able, in Smith’s time, to produce over 48,000 pins a day.

Smith was impressed by the great improvements in the productivity of labor that took place during the Industrial Revolution—improvements that saw workers provided with much better equipment, and often saw machines replacing workers.

The jack-of-all-trades could not survive in such a system, and even philosophers began to specialize in the various branches of their subject, such as logic, ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics.

The market is the key to establishing an equitable society, in Smith’s view. With the freedom provided by the buying and selling of goods, individuals can enjoy lives of “natural liberty.”

"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor seem to have been the effects of the division of labor."

Adam Smith

The free market

Because the division of labor increases productivity and makes it possible for everyone to be eligible for some kind of work (since it frees us from training in a craft), Smith argues that it can lead to universal wealth in a well-ordered society. Indeed, he says that in conditions of perfect liberty, the market can lead to a state of perfect equality—one in which everyone is free to pursue his own interests in his own way, so long as it accords with the laws of justice. And by equality Smith is not referring to equality of opportunity, but to equality of condition. In other words, his goal is the creation of a society not divided by competitiveness, but drawn together by bargaining based on mutual self-interest.

Smith’s point, therefore, is not that people should have freedom just because they deserve it. His point is that society as a whole benefits from individuals pursuing their own interests. For the “invisible hand” of the market, with its laws of supply and demand, regulates the amount of goods that are available, and prices them far more efficiently than any government could. Put simply, the pursuit of self-interest, far from being incompatible with an equitable society, is, in Smith’s view, the only way of guaranteeing it.

In such a society, a government can limit itself to performing just a few essential functions, such as providing defense, criminal justice, and education, and taxes and duties can be reduced accordingly. And just as bargaining can flourish within national boundaries, so it can flourish across them, leading to international trade—a phenomenon that was spreading across the world in Smith’s time.

Smith recognized that there were problems with the notion of a free market—in particular with the increasingly common bargain of wages for working time. He also acknowledged that while the division of labor had huge economic benefits, repetitive work is not only boring for the worker, it can destroy a human being—and for this reason he proposed that governments should restrict the extent to which the production line is used. Nevertheless, when The Wealth of Nations was first published, its doctrine of free and unregulated trade was seen as revolutionary, not only because of its attack on established commercial and agricultural privileges and monopolies, but also because of its argument that a nation’s wealth depends not on its gold reserves, but on its labor—a view that went against all economic thinking in Europe at the time.

Smith’s reputation for being a revolutionary was bolstered during the long debate about the nature of society that followed the French Revolution of 1789, prompting the mid-Victorian historian H.T. Buckle to describe The Wealth of Nations as “probably the most important book that has ever been written.”

Smith’s legacy

Critics have argued that Smith was wrong to assume that the “general interest” and “consumer interest” are the same, and that the free market is beneficial to all. What is true is that even though Smith was sympathetic toward the victims of poverty, he never fully succeeded in balancing the interests of producers and consumers within his social model, or integrating into it the domestic labor, performed mainly by women, that helped to keep society running efficiently.

For these reasons, and with the rise of socialism in the 19th century, Smith’s reputation declined, but renewed interest in free market economics in the late 20th century saw a revival of Smith’s ideas. Indeed, only today can we fully appreciate his most visionary claim—that a market is more than just a place. A market is a concept, and as such can exist anywhere—not only in a designated place such as a town square. This foreshadows the kind of “virtual” marketplace that only became possible with the advent of telecommunications technology. Today’s financial markets and online trading bear witness to Smith’s great vision.

"Civilized society stands at all times in need of the cooperation and assistance of great multitudes."

Adam Smith

The production line is an incredible money-creating machine, but Smith warns against the dehumanizing effects it can have on workers if it is used without regulation.

ADAM SMITH

The “father of modern economics” was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 1723. An academic prodigy, Smith became a professor first at Edinburgh University, then at Glasgow University where he became a professor in 1750. In the 1760s, he took a lucrative job as a personal tutor to a young Scottish aristocrat, Henry Scott, with whom he visited France and Switzerland.

Already acquainted with David Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, he seized the chance to meet leading figures of the European Enlightenment as well. On his return to Scotland, he spent a decade writing The Wealth of Nations, before returning to public service as Commissioner of Customs, a position that allowed him to advise the British government on various economic policies. In 1787, he rejoined Glasgow University, and spent the last three years of his life as its rector.

## Conservatism

BEFORE

c.350 BCE Aristotle argues that society is like an organism, and that man is by nature a political animal.

5th century St. Augustine of Hippo argues that government is a form of punishment for “original sin.”

17th century Thomas Hobbes and John Locke develop the idea of the “social contract.”

AFTER

19th century French philosopher Joseph de Maistre points out the antidemocratic legacy of Burke since the French Revolution.

20th century British philosopher Michael Oakeshott develops a more liberal form of conservatism.

Many a disaffected person cries “It’s not my fault… blame society!” But the meaning of the word “society” is not entirely clear, and it has changed over time. During the 18th century, when the Irish philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke was writing, Europe was becoming increasingly commercialized, and the idea that society is a mutual agreement between its members—like a commercial company—was readily understood. However, this point of view also implies that it is only the material things in life that matter. Burke attempts to redress the balance by reminding us that human beings also enrich their lives through science, art, and virtue, and that while society is indeed a contract or partnership, it is not simply concerned with economics, or, as he puts it, “gross animal existence.” Society embodies the common good (our agreement on customs, norms, and values), but for Burke “society” means more than just the people living now—it also includes our ancestors and descendants. Moreover, because every political constitution is part of “the great primeval contract of eternal society”, God himself is society’s ultimate guarantor.

Burke’s view has the doctrine of original sin (the idea that we are born sinful) at its core, so he has little sympathy for anyone seeking to blame society for their conduct. Likewise, he dismisses the idea, proposed by John Locke, that we can be perfected by education—as though we are born innocent and merely need to be given the correct influences. For Burke, the fallibility of individual judgment is why we need tradition, to give us the moral bearings we need—an argument that echoes David Hume, who claimed that “custom is the great guide to human life.”

Tradition and change

Because society is an organic structure with roots stretching deep into the past, Burke believed its political organization should develop naturally over time. He opposed the idea of sweeping or abrupt political changes that cut through this natural process. For this reason he opposed the French Revolution of 1789, foreseeing its dangers long before the execution of the king and the year-long Reign of Terror. It also prompted him on several occasions to criticize Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose book, The Social Contract, argued that the contract between citizens and the state can be broken at any time, depending on the will of the people. Another regular target for Burke was the English philosopher and scientist Joseph Priestley, who applauded the French Revolution and pilloried the idea of original sin.

Despite his scepticism about modern commercial society, Burke was a great defender of private property, and was optimistic about the free market. For this reason, he is often hailed as the “father of modern conservatism”—a philosophy that values both economic freedom and tradition. Today, even socialists would agree with Burke that private property is a fundamental social institution, but would disagree with him about its value. Likewise, ecologically-minded philosophers share his belief in the duties of one generation to the next, but with the new agenda of creating a “sustainable society.”

Burke condemned the French Revolution for its wholesale rejection of the past. He believed that change should occur gradually—an idea that became central to modern conservatism.

EDMUND BURKE

The Anglo-Irish politician Edmund Burke was born and educated in Dublin. From his youth onward, he was convinced that philosophy was useful training for politics, and in the 1750s he wrote notable essays on aesthetics and the origins of society. He served as an English MP from 1766 until 1794, and he was a prominent member of the Whig party—the more liberal of the two aristocratic parties of the day.

Burke was sympathetic toward the cause of American independence—which sparked a revolution that was entirely justified, in his view—and later became involved in the impeachment trial of Warren Hastings, the Governor-General of India. He remained a scathing critic of colonial malpractice for the rest of his life, and earned a reputation for being the conscience of the British Empire.

## Feminism

BEFORE

4th century BCE Plato advises that girls should have a similar education to boys.

4th century CE Hypatia, a noted female mathematician and philosopher, teaches in Alexandria, Egypt.

1790 In Letters on Education, British historian Catherine Macaulay claims the apparent weakness of women is caused by their miseducation.

AFTER

1869 John Stuart Mill’s The Subjection of Women argues for equality of the sexes.

Late 20th century A surge of feminist activism begins to overturn most of the social and political inequalities between the sexes in Western society.

For most of recorded history, women have been seen as subordinate to men. But during the 18th century, the justice of this arrangement began to be openly challenged. Among the most prominent voices of dissent was that of the English radical Mary Wollstonecraft.

Many previous thinkers had cited the physical differences between the sexes to justify the social inequality between women and men. However, in the light of new ideas that had been formulated during the 17th century, such as John Locke’s view that nearly all knowledge was acquired through experience and education, the validity of such reasoning was being called into question.

Equal education

Wollstonecraft argues that if men and women are given the same education they will acquire the same good character and rational approach to life, because they have fundamentally similar brains and minds. Her book, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, published in 1792, was partly a response to Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Emile (1762), which recommends that girls be educated differently to boys, and that they learn deference to them.

Wollstonecraft’s demand that women be treated as equal citizens to men—with equal legal, social, and political rights—was still largely treated with derision in the late 18th century. But it did sow the seeds of the suffragette and feminist movements that were to flourish in the 19th and 20th centuries.

"Let woman share the rights and she will emulate the virtues of man."

Mary Wollstonecraft

## Utilitarianism

BEFORE

1651 In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes says that people are “brutish” and must be controlled by a social contract.

1689 John Locke’s book, Two Treatises of Government, looks at social contract theory in the context of empiricism.

1789 Jeremy Bentham advocates the “greatest happiness principle.”

AFTER

1930s Economist J.M. Keynes, influenced by Mill, develops liberal economic theories.

1971 John Rawls publishes A Theory of Justice, based on the idea that laws should be those everyone would accept.

John Stuart Mill was born into an intellectually privileged family, and he was aware from an early age of the British traditions of philosophy that had emerged during the Enlightenment of the 18th century. John Locke and David Hume had established a philosophy whose new empiricism stood in stark contrast to the rationalism of continental European philosophers. But during the late 18th century, Romantic ideas from Europe began to influence British moral and political philosophy. The most obvious product of this influence was utilitarianism, which was a very British interpretation of the political philosophy that had shaped the 18th-century revolutions of both Europe and America. Its originator, Jeremy Bentham, was a friend of the Mill family, and he influenced John’s home education.

Victorian liberalism

As a philosopher Mill sets himself the task of synthesizing a valuable intellectual heritage with the new 19th-century Romanticism. His approach is less sceptical than that of Hume (who argued that all knowledge comes from sense experience, and nothing is certain) and less dogmatic than Bentham (who insisted that everything be judged on its usefulness), but their empiricism and utilitarianism informed his thinking. Mill’s moral and political philosophy is less extreme than his predecessors’, aiming for reform rather than revolution, and it formed the basis of British Victorian liberalism.

After completing his first philosophical work, the exhaustive six-volume System of Logic, Mill turned his attention to moral philosophy, particularly Bentham’s theories of utilitarianism. He had been struck by the elegant simplicity of Bentham’s principle of “the greatest happiness for the greatest number”, and was a firm believer in its usefulness. He describes his interpretation of how utilitarianism might be applied as similar to Jesus of Nazareth’s “golden rule”: do as you would be done by, and love your neighbor as yourself. This, he says, constitutes “the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.”

Legislating for liberty

Mill supports Bentham’s happiness principle, but he thinks it lacks practicality. Bentham had seen the idea as depending upon an abstract “felicific calculus” (an algorithm for calculating happiness), but Mill wants to find out how it might be implemented in the real world. He is interested in the social and political implications of the principle, rather than merely its use in making moral decisions. How would legislation promoting the “greatest happiness of the greatest number” actually affect the individual? Might laws that sought to do this, enacting a kind of majority rule, actually prevent some people from achieving happiness?

Mill thinks that the solution is for education and public opinion to work together to establish an “indissoluble association” between an individual’s happiness and the good of society. As a result, people would always be motivated to act not only for their own good or happiness, but toward that of everyone. He concludes that society should therefore allow all individuals the freedom to pursue happiness. Furthermore, he says that this right should be protected by the government, and that legislation should be drawn up to protect the individual’s freedom to pursue personal goals. There is, however, one situation in which this freedom should be curtailed, Mill says, and that is where one person’s action impinges on the happiness of others. This is known as the “harm principle.” He underlines this by pointing out that in these cases, a person’s “own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.”

The good samaritan helps his enemy in a biblical parable that demonstrates Mill’s golden rule: do as you would be done by. He believed this would raise society’s overall level of happiness.

"It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."

John Stuart Mill

Quantifying happiness

Mill then turns his attention to how best to measure happiness. Bentham had considered the duration and intensity of pleasures in his felicific calculus, but Mill thinks it is also important to consider the quality of pleasure. By this, he is referring to the difference between a simple satisfaction of desires and sensual pleasures, and happiness gained through intellectual and cultural pursuits. In the “happiness equation” he gives more weight to higher, intellectual pleasures than to baser, physical ones.

In line with his empiricist background, Mill then tries to pin down the essence of happiness. What is it, he asks, that each individual is striving to achieve? What causes happiness? He decides that “the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it.” This seems a rather unsatisfactory explanation, but he goes on to distinguish between two different desires: unmotivated desires (the things we want that will give us pleasure) and conscientious actions (the things we do out a sense of duty or charity, often against our immediate inclination, that ultimately bring us pleasure). In the first case, we desire something as a part of our happiness, but in the second we desire it as a means to our happiness, which is felt only when the act reaches its virtuous end.

Practical utilitarianism

Mill was not a purely academic philosopher, and he believed his ideas should be put into practice, so he considered what this might mean in terms of government and legislation. He saw any restriction of the individual’s freedom to pursue happiness as a tyranny, whether this was the collective tyranny of the majority (through democratic election) or the singular rule of a despot. He therefore suggested practical measures to restrict the power of society over the individual, and to protect the rights of the individual to free expression.

In his time as a Member of Parliament, Mill proposed many reforms which were not to come about until much later, but his speeches brought the liberal applications of his utilitarian philosophy to the attention of a wide public. As a philosopher and politician, he argued strongly in defense of free speech, for the promotion of basic human rights, and against slavery—all of which were obvious practical applications of his utilitarianism. Strongly influenced by his wife Harriet Taylor-Mill, he was the first British parliamentarian to propose votes for women as part of his government reforms. His liberalist philosophy also encompassed economics, and contrary to his father’s economic theories, he advocated a free-market economy where government intervention is kept to a minimum.

The National Society for Women’s Suffrage was set up in Britain in 1868, a year after Mill tried to secure their legal right to vote by arguing for an amendment to the 1867 Reform Act.

A softer revolution

Mill places the individual, rather than society, at the center of his utilitarian philosophy. What is important is that individuals are free to think and act as they please, without interference, even if what they do is harmful to them. Every individual, says Mill in his essay On Liberty, is “sovereign over his own body and mind.” His ideas came to embody Victorian liberalism, softening the radical ideas that had led to revolutions in Europe and America, and combining them with the idea of freedom from interference by authority. This, for Mill, is the basis for just governance and the means to social progress, which was an important Victorian ideal. He believes that if society leaves individuals to live in a way that makes them happy, it enables them to achieve their potential. This in turn benefits society, as the achievements of individual talents contribute to the good of all.

In his own lifetime Mill was regarded as a significant philosopher, and he is now considered by many to be the architect of Victorian liberalism. His utilitarian-inspired philosophy had a direct influence on social, political, philosophical, and economic thinking well into the 20th century. Modern economics has been shaped from various interpretations of his application of utilitarianism to the free market, notably by the British economist John Maynard Keynes. In the field of ethics, philosophers such as Bertrand Russell, Karl Popper, William James, and John Rawls all took Mill as their starting point.

"One person with a belief is a social power equal to 99 who have only interests."

John Stuart Mill

JOHN STUART MILL

John Stuart Mill was born in London in 1806. His father was the Scottish philosopher and historian James Mill, who founded the movement of “philosophical radicals” with Jeremy Bentham. John was educated at home by his father, whose demanding program began with teaching Greek to John when he was only three years old.

After years of intense study, Mill suffered a breakdown at the age of 20. He left university to work for the East India Company, where he stayed until his retirement in 1857, as it gave him a living and time to write. During this period he met Harriet Taylor, advocate of women’s rights, who—after a relationship of 20 years—eventually became his wife. Mill served as a Member of Parliament from 1865 to 1868, putting into practice his moral and political philosophy.

AFTER

1930s Marxism becomes the official philosophy of the Soviet Union and many other communist countries.

Can the complex history of the human species be reduced to a single formula? One of the greatest thinkers of the 19th century, Karl Marx, believed that it could. He opened the first chapter of his most famous work, The Communist Manifesto, with the claim that all historical change comes about as the result of an ongoing conflict between dominant (upper) and subordinate (lower) social classes, and that the roots of this conflict lie in economics.

Marx believed that he had gained a uniquely important insight into the nature of society through the ages. Earlier approaches to history had emphasized the role of individual heroes and leaders, or stressed the role played by ideas, but Marx focused on a long succession of group conflicts, including those between ancient masters and slaves, medieval lords and serfs, and modern employers and their employees. It was conflicts between these classes, he claimed, that caused revolutionary change.

The Communist Manifesto

Marx wrote the Manifesto with the German philosopher Friedrich Engels, whom he had met when they were both studying academic philosophy in Germany during the late 1830s. Engels offered financial support, ideas, and superior writing skills, but Marx was acknowledged as the real genius behind their combined publications.

In their private manuscripts from the early and mid-1840s, Marx and Engels emphasized that while previous philosophers had only sought to interpret the world, the whole point of their activities was to change it. During the 1850s and 60s Marx refined his ideas in many short documents, including The Communist Manifesto, a pamphlet of about 40 pages.

The Manifesto seeks to explain the values and political plans of communism—a new belief system put forward by a small and relatively new group of radical German socialists. The Manifesto claims that society had simplified into two classes in direct conflict: the bourgeoisie (the capital-owning class) and the proletariat (the working class).

The word “bourgeoisie” is derived from the French word burgeis, or burgher: a property-owning tradesman who had risen above the general populace to own and run his own business. Marx describes how the discovery and colonization of America, the opening of the Indian and Chinese markets, and the increase in the commodities that could be exchanged had, by the mid-19th century, led to the rapid development of commerce and industry. Craftsmen no longer produced enough goods for the growing needs of new markets, and so the manufacturing system had taken their place. As the Manifesto relates, “the markets kept growing, demand ever rising.”

Intellectual debate was widespread in Germany at the time Marx was writing, though he himself believed that it was the task of philosophy not to discuss ideas, but to bring about real change.

Values of the bourgeoisie

Marx claims that the bourgeoisie, who controlled all this trade, had left no link between people other “than naked self-interest, than callous ‘cash payment.’” People were once valued for who they were, but the bourgeoisie “has resolved personal worth into exchange value.” Moral, religious, and even sentimental values had been cast aside, as everyone—from scientists and lawyers to priests and poets—had been transformed into nothing but a paid laborer. In place of religious and political “illusions”, Marx writes, the bourgeoisie had “substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.” Charters that had once protected people’s freedom had been cast aside for one “unconscionable freedom—Free Trade.”

The only solution, according to Marx, was for all the instruments of economic production (such as land, raw materials, tools, and factories) to become common property, so that every member of society could work according to their capacities, and consume according to their needs. This was the only way to prevent the rich from living at the expense of the poor.

Dialectical change

The philosophy behind Marx’s reasoning on the process of change came largely from his predecessor, Georg Hegel, who had described reality not as a state of affairs, but as a process of continual change. The change was caused, he said, by the fact that every idea or state of affairs (known as the “thesis”) contains within it an internal conflict (the “antithesis”) that eventually forces a change to occur, leading to a new idea or state of affairs (the “synthesis”). This process is known as the dialectic.

Hegel believed that we can never experience things in the world as they are, but only as they appear to us. For him, existence primarily consists of mind or spirit, so the journey of history, through countless cycles of the dialectic, is essentially the progress of spirit, or Geist, toward a state of absolute harmony. But it is here that Hegel and Marx part company. Marx insists that the process is not a journey of spiritual development, but of real historical change. Marx claims that the final, conflict-free state that lies at the end of the process is not the spiritual bliss that Hegel predicted, but the perfect society, where everyone works harmoniously toward the good of a greater whole.

"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs."

Karl Marx

The formation of classes

In earlier ages, humans had been entirely responsible for producing everything they needed—such as clothing, food, and habitation—for themselves, but as the early societies began to form, people came to rely more on one another. This led to the form of “bargain making” described by the Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith, as people exchanged goods or labor. Marx agrees with Smith that this system of exchange led people to specialize in their labor, but he points out that this new specialization (or “job”) had also come to define them. Whatever a person’s specialization or job, be it agricultural laborer or hereditary landowner, it had come to dictate where he or she lived, what they ate, and what they wore; it also dictated with whom in society they shared interests, and with whom their interests lay in conflict. Over time, this led to the formation of distinct socio-economic classes, locked into conflict.

According to Marx, there have been four major stages in human history, which he sees as based on four different forms of property ownership: the original tribal system of common property; the ancient communal and state system of ownership (where both slavery and private property began); the feudal or estate system of property; and the modern system of capitalist production. Each of these stages represents a different form of economic system, or “mode of production”, and the transitions between them are marked in history by stormy political events, such as wars and revolutions, as one ruling class is displaced by another. The Communist Manifesto popularized the idea that through understanding the system of property ownership in any one society, in any particular era, we can acquire the key to understanding its social relations.

The wealthy bourgeoisie enjoyed the luxuries of life in the late 18th and 19th centuries, while the workers in their companies and on their estates endured terrible poverty.

"The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class."

Karl Marx

Rise of cultural institutions

Marx also believes that an analysis of the economic basis of any society allows us to see that as its system of property alters, so too do its “superstructures”—such as its politics, laws, art, religions, and philosophies. These develop to serve the interests of the ruling class, promoting its values and interests, and diverting attention away from political realities. However, even this ruling class is not, in fact, determining events or institutions. Hegel had said that every age is held in the sway of the Zeitgeist, or spirit of the age, and Marx agrees. But where Hegel saw the Zeitgeist as determined by an Absolute Spirit developing over time, Marx sees it as defined by the social and economic relations of an era. These define the ideas or “consciousness” of individuals and societies. In Marx’s view, people do not make a stamp on their era, molding it into a particular shape; the era defines the people.

Marx’s revision of Hegel’s philosophy from a journey of spirit to one of social and economic modes of production was also influenced by another German philosopher, Ludwig Feuerbach. Feuerbach believed that traditional religion is intellectually false—it is not corroborated in any way by reasoning—and that it contributes to the general sum of human misery. He claimed that people make gods in their own image from an amalgamation of humanity’s greatest virtues, and then cling to these gods and invented religions, preferring their “dreams” to the real world. People become alienated from themselves, through an unfavorable comparison of their selves to a god that they have forgotten they created.

Marx agrees that people cling to religion because they long for a place in which the self is not despised or alienated, but he says that this is not due to some authoritarian god, but to material facts in their actual, daily lives. The answer for Marx lies not only in the end of religion, but in total social and political change.

"The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for real happiness."

Karl Marx

A Marxist utopia

In addition to its general account of human history leading to the rise of the bourgeois and proletarian classes, The Communist Manifesto makes a variety of other claims about politics, society, and economics. For example, it argues that the capitalist system is not merely exploitative, but also inherently financially unstable, leading to the recurrence of increasingly severe commercial crises, the growing poverty of the workforce, and the emergence of the proletariat as the one genuinely revolutionary class. For the first time in history, this revolutionary class would represent the vast majority of humanity.

These developments are seen as underpinned by the increasingly complex nature of the process of production. Marx predicted that as technology improved, it would lead to increasing unemployment, alienating more and more people from the means of production. This would split society in two, between the large numbers of impoverished people and the few who owned and controlled the means of production. Following the rules of the dialectic, this conflict would result in a violent revolution to establish a new, classless society. This would be the utopian, conflict-free society that marked the end of the dialectic. Marx thought this perfect society would not require government, but only administration, and this would be carried out by the leaders of the revolution: the communist “party” (by which he means those who adhered to the cause, rather than any specific organization). Within this new kind of state (which Marx called the “dictatorship of the proletariat”) people would enjoy genuine democracy and social ownership of wealth. Shortly after this final change in the mode of production to a perfect society, Marx predicted, political power as it had previously been understood would come to an end, because there would be no good reason for political dissent or criminality.

The Industrial Revolution saw the formalization of specialized skills into paid employment. People then formed into groups, or classes, made up of those with similar socio-economic status.

Socialist-inspired revolutions swept through Europe just after the publication of The Communist Manifesto. These included the February Revolution of 1848 in Paris.

Political power

Marx predicted that the outcome of the intense class struggles in Europe between the bourgeoisie and the wage-earning working class would become evident only when the great mass of people had become property-less and were obliged to sell their labor for wages. The juxtaposition of poverty with the great wealth of the few would become increasingly obvious, he thought, and communism would become increasingly attractive.

However, Marx did not expect the opponents of communism to give up their privileges easily. In every period of history, the ruling class has enjoyed the advantage of controlling both the government and the law as a way of reinforcing their economic dominance. The modern state, he said, was actually a “committee for managing the affairs of the bourgeois class”, and struggles by excluded groups to have their own interests taken into account—such as the battle to extend the right to vote—were simply short-term ways in which the more fundamental economic conflict found expression. Marx saw political interests and parties as merely vehicles for the economic interests of the ruling classes, which were forced to appear as though they were acting in the general interest in order to gain and maintain power.

The road to revolution

Marx’s originality lies in his combination of pre-existing ideas rather than the creation of new ones. His system uses insights from German idealist philosophers, especially Georg Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach; from French political theorists, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau; and from British political economists, particularly Adam Smith. Socialism had become a recognized political doctrine in the first half of the 19th century, and from this Marx derives several insights about property, class, exploitation, and commercial crises.

Class conflict was certainly in the air when Marx composed the Manifesto. It was written just before a succession of revolutions against the monarchies of many continental European countries broke out in 1848 and 1849. In the preceding decades, a significant number of people had migrated from the countryside to the towns in search of work, although continental Europe had not yet seen the industrial development that had taken place in Britain. A wave of discontent felt by the poor against the status quo was exploited by a variety of liberal and nationalist politicians, and revolutions rippled across Europe, although ultimately these uprisings were defeated and led to little permanent change.

However, the Manifesto acquired an iconic status during the 20th century, inspiring revolutions in Russia, China, and many other countries. The brilliance of Marx’s theories has been proved wrong in practice: the extent of repression in Stalinist Russia, in Mao Zedong’s China, and in Pol Pot’s Cambodia, has widely discredited his political and historical theories.

"A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism."

Karl Marx

Criticism of Marxism

Although Marx did not foresee communism being implemented in such a barbaric manner in these primarily agricultural societies, his ideas are nevertheless still open to a variety of criticisms. First, Marx always argued for the inevitability of revolution. This was the essential part of the dialectic, but it is clearly too simplistic, as human creativity is always able to produce a variety of choices, and the dialectic fails to allow for the possibility of improvement by gradual reform.

Second, Marx tended to invest the proletariat with wholly good attributes, and to suggest that a communist society would give rise somehow to a new type of human being. He never explained how the dictatorship of this perfect proletariat would be different from earlier, brutal forms of dictatorship, nor how it would avoid the corrupting effects of power.

Third, Marx rarely discussed the possibility that new threats to liberty might emerge after a successful revolution; he assumed that poverty was the only real cause of criminality. His critics have also alleged that he did not sufficiently understand the forces of nationalism, and that he gave no proper account of the role of personal leadership in politics. In fact, the 20th-century communist movement was to produce immensely powerful personality cults in virtually every country in which communists came to power.

Marxist states of the 20th century promoted themselves as utopias. They produced a proliferation of paintings and statues glorifying the achievements of their happy, newly liberated citizens.

Lasting influence

Despite the criticism and crises that Marx’s theories have provoked, his ideas have been hugely influential. As a powerful critic of commercial capitalism, and as an economic and socialist theorist, Marx is still considered relevant to politics and economics today. Many would agree with the 20th-century Russian-British philosopher, Isaiah Berlin, that the The Communist Manifesto is “a work of genius.”

KARL MARX

The most famous revolutionary thinker of the 19th century was born in the German city of Trier. The son of a Jewish lawyer who had converted to Christianity, Marx studied law at Bonn University, where he met his future wife, Jenny von Westphalen. He then studied at the University of Berlin, before working as a journalist. The favor he bestowed on democracy in his writing led to censorship by the Prussian royal family, and he was forced into exile in France and Belgium. During this time he developed a unique theory of communism in collaboration with his German compatriot Friedrich Engels.

Marx returned to Germany during the 1848–49 revolutions, but after they were quashed he lived in exile in London for the rest of his life. He and his wife lived in extreme poverty, and when Marx died stateless at the age of 64, there were only 11 mourners at his funeral.

Almost a century after Jean-Jacques Rousseau claimed that nature was essentially benign, American philosopher Henry Thoreau developed the idea further, arguing that “all good things are wild and free”, and that the laws of man suppress rather than protect civil liberties. He saw that political parties were necessarily one-sided, and that their policies often ran contrary to our moral beliefs. For this reason, he believed it was the individual’s duty to protest against unjust laws, and argued that passively allowing such laws to be enacted effectively gave them justification. “Any fool can make a rule, and any fool will mind it,” as he said about English grammar, but the principle runs through his political philosophy too.

In his essay Civil Disobedience, written in 1849, Thoreau proposes a citizen’s right to conscientious objection through non-cooperation and non-violent resistance—which he put into practice by refusing to pay taxes that supported the war in Mexico and perpetuated slavery.

Thoreau’s ideas contrasted sharply with those of his contemporary Karl Marx, and with the revolutionary spirit in Europe at the time, which called for violent action. But they were later adopted by numerous leaders of resistance movements, such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

Mahatma Gandhi’s campaign of civil disobedience against British rule in India included the Salt March of 1930, undertaken in protest against unjust laws controlling salt production.

2000 Slavoj Žižek explores the relationship between technology, capitalist society, and totalitarianism.

At first glance, nothing seems to be more irrational than Marcuse’s claim that “that which is” cannot be true, which appears in his 1941 book, Reason and Revolution. If that which is cannot be true, the reader is tempted to ask, then what is? But Marcuse’s idea is partly an attempt to overturn the claim made by the German philosopher Hegel that what is rational is actual, and also that what is actual is rational.

Marcuse believes this is a dangerous idea because it leads us to think that what is actually the case—such as our existing political system—is necessarily rational. He reminds us that those things we take as reasonable may be far more unreasonable than we like to admit. He also wants to shake us up into realizing the irrational nature of many of the things that we -take for granted.

Subversive reason

In particular, Marcuse is deeply uneasy with capitalist societies and with what he calls their “terrifying harmony of freedom and oppression, productivity and destruction, growth and regression.” We assume that the societies we live in are based upon reason and justice, but when we look more closely, we may find that they are neither as just nor as reasonable as we believe.

Marcuse is not discounting reason, but trying to point out that reason is subversive, and that we can use it to call into question the society in which we live. The aim of philosophy, for Marcuse, is a “rationalist theory of society.”

Fast cars are the kind of consumables that Marcuse accuses us of using to recognize ourselves; he says we find “our soul” in these items, becoming mere extensions of the things we create.

1974 Robert Nozick criticizes Rawls’ “original position” in his influential book Anarchy, State, and Utopia.

2001 Rawls defends his views in his last book, Justice as Fairness: A Restatement.

In his book A Theory of Justice, first published in 1971, political philosopher John Rawls argues for a re-evaluation of justice in terms of what he calls “justice as fairness.” His approach falls into the tradition known as social contract theory, which sees the rule of law as a form of contract that individuals enter into because it yields benefits that exceed what they can attain individually. Rawls’ version of this theory involves a thought experiment in which people are made ignorant of their place in society, or placed in what he calls the “original position” in which the social contract is made. From this Rawls establishes principles of justice on which, he claims, all rational beings should agree.

The original position

Imagine that a group of strangers is marooned on a desert island, and that, after giving up hope of being rescued, they decide to start a new society from scratch. Each of the survivors wants to further their own interests, but each also sees that they can only do so by working together in some way—in other words, by forming a social contract. The question is: how do they go about establishing the principles of justice? What rules do they lay down? If they are interested in a truly rational and impartial justice, then there are countless rules that have to be discounted immediately. For example, the rule “If your name is John, you must always eat last”, is neither rational nor impartial, even if it may be to your advantage if your name is “John.”

In such a position, says Rawls, what we need to do is cast a “veil of ignorance” over all the facts of our lives, such as who we are, and where we were born, and then ask what kind of rules it would be best for us to live by. Rawls’ point is that the only rules that could rationally be agreed on by all parties are ones that genuinely honor impartiality, and don’t, for example, take race, class, creed, natural talent, or disability into account. In other words, if I don’t know what my place in society will be, rational self-interest compels me to vote for a world in which everyone is treated fairly.

Rationality versus charity

It is important to note that for Rawls this is not a story about how justice has actually arisen in the world. Instead, he gives us a way of testing our theories of justice against an impartial benchmark. If they fail to measure up, his point is that it is our reason, and not simply our charity, that has failed.

The representation of justice as a blindfolded lady with a set of scales expresses the idea that no-one is above the law.

JOHN RAWLS

John Rawls was born in 1921 in Maryland, USA. He studied at Princeton University, then joined the army and served in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, in which he saw the ruins of Hiroshima, he resigned from the army and returned to studying philosophy, earning his PhD from Princeton in 1950.

Rawls undertook further study at Oxford University, where he met philosopher Isaiah Berlin, before returning to the US to teach. After a period at Cornell and MIT, he moved to Harvard, where he wrote A Theory of Justice. While at Harvard, he also taught up-and-coming philosophers Thomas Nagel and Martha Nussbaum.

In 1995 Rawls suffered the first of several strokes, but continued working until his death in 2002.

AFTER

1977 Steve Biko, an anti-apartheid activist inspired by Fanon, dies in police custody in South Africa.

1978 Edward Said, influenced by Fanon’s work, writes Orientalism, a post-colonial study of Western perspectives on the Middle East in the 19th century.

P hilosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon first published his psychoanalytic study of colonialism and racism, Black Skin, White Masks, in 1952. In the book Fanon attempts to explore the psychological and social legacy of colonialism among non-white communities around the world.

In saying that “for the black man, there is only one destiny”, and this destiny is white, Fanon is saying at least two things. First, he says that “the black man wants to be like the white man”; that is, the aspirations of many colonized peoples have been formed by the dominant colonial culture. European colonial cultures tended to equate “blackness” with impurity, which shaped the self-view of those who were subject to colonial rule, so that they came to see the color of their skin as a sign of inferiority.

The only way out of this predicament seems to be an aspiration to achieve a “white existence”; but this will always fail, because the fact of having dark skin will always mean that one will fail to be accepted as white. For Fanon, this aspiration to achieve “a white existence” not only fails to address racism and inequality, but it also masks or even condones these things by implying that there is an “unarguable superiority” to white existence.

At the same time, Fanon is saying something more complex. It might be thought that, given this tendency to aspire to a kind of “white existence”, the solution would be to argue for an independent view of what it means to be black. Yet this, too, is subject to all kinds of problems. Elsewhere in his book, Fanon writes that “the black man’s soul is a white man’s artefact.” In other words, the idea of what it means to be black is the creation of patterns of fundamentally racist European thought.

Here Fanon is, in part, responding to what was known in France as the négritude (or “blackness”) movement. This was a movement of French and French-speaking black writers from the 1930s who wanted to reject the racism and colonialism of mainstream French culture, and argued for an independent, shared black culture. But Fanon believes that this idea of négritude is one that fails to truly address the problems of racism that it seeks to overcome, because the way that it thinks about “blackness” simply repeats the fantasies of mainstream white culture.

"There is a fact: White men consider themselves superior to black men."

Frantz Fanon

Human rights

In one sense, Fanon believes that the solution can only come when we move beyond racial thinking; that if we remain trapped within the idea of race we cannot ever address these injustices. “I find myself in the world and I recognize that I have one right alone,” Fanon writes at the end of his book; “that of demanding human behavior from the other.” Fanon’s thought has been of widespread importance in anti-colonial and anti-racist movements, and has influenced social activists such as anti-apartheid campaigner Steve Biko and scholars such as Edward Said.

The inferiority associated with being black led many colonized people to adopt the “mother country’s cultural standards”, says Fanon, and even to aspire to a “white existence.”

FRANTZ FANON

Frantz Fanon was born in 1925 in Martinique, a Caribbean island that was at that time a French colony. He left Martinique to fight with the Free French Forces in World War II, after which he studied both medicine and psychiatry in Lyon, France. He also attended lectures on literature and philosophy, including those given by the philosopher Merleau-Ponty. The young Fanon had thought of himself as French, and the racism he encountered on first entering France surprised him. It played a huge role in shaping his philosophy, and one year after qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951, he published his book Black Skin, White Masks.

In 1953 Fanon moved to Algeria where he worked as a hospital psychiatrist. After two years of hearing his patients’ tales of the torture they endured during the 1954–62 Algerian War of Independence, he resigned his government-funded post, moved to Tunisia, and began working for the Algerian independence movement. In the late 1950s, he developed leukemia. During his illness, he wrote his final book, The Wretched of the Earth, arguing for a different world. It was published in the year of his death with a preface by Jean-Paul Sartre, a friend who had first influenced Fanon, then been influenced by him.

1999 Canadian author Naomi Klein’s No Logo explores the fate of the public sphere in an era dominated by advertising and the mass media.

According to the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas, modern society depends not only on technological advances, but also upon our ability to criticize and reason collectively about our own traditions. Reason, says Habermas, lies at the heart of our everyday communications. Somebody says or does something, and we say, “Why did you do that?” or “Why did you say that?” We continually ask for justifications, which is why Habermas talks about “communicative” reason. Reason, for him, is not about discovering abstract truths, but about the need we have to justify ourselves to others.

Creating a public sphere

In the 1960s and 1970s, Habermas concluded that there was a link between communicative reason and what he calls the “public sphere.” Up until the 18th century, he states, European culture was largely “representational”, meaning that the ruling classes sought to “represent” themselves to their subjects with displays of power that required no justification, such as impressive pageants or grand architectural projects. But in the 18th century, a variety of public spaces emerged that were outside state control, including literary salons and coffee houses. These were places where individuals could gather to engage in conversation or reasoned debate. This growth of the public sphere led to increased opportunities to question the authority of representational state culture. The public sphere became a “third space”, a buffer between the private space of our immediate friends and family, and the space occupied by state control.

By establishing a public sphere, we also open up more opportunities for recognizing that we have interests in common with other private individuals—interests that the state may fail to serve. This can lead to questioning the actions of the state. Habermas believes that the growth of the public sphere helped to trigger the French Revolution in 1789.

The expansion of the public sphere, from the 18th century onward, has led to a growth of democratically elected political institutions, independent courts, and bills of rights. But Habermas believes that many of these brakes on the arbitrary use of power are now under threat. Newspapers, for example, can offer opportunities for reasoned dialogue between private individuals, but if the press is controlled by large corporations, such opportunities may diminish. Informed debate on issues of substance is replaced with celebrity gossip, and we are transformed from critical, rational agents into mindless consumers.

Coffee houses became a focus of social and political life in the major cities of 18th-century Europe. Noted as places where “the dissaffected met”, attempts were frequently made to close them.

JÜRGEN HABERMAS

Jürgen Habermas grew up in Germany under the Nazi regime. His realization that “we had been living in a criminal system”, following the Nuremburg trials (1945–46), was to have a lasting effect on his philosophy.

On completing his doctorate in 1954, he studied with members of the Frankfurt School, including Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno. During the 1960s and 1970s, he lectured at universities in Bonn and Gottingen. In 1982, he became Professor of Philosophy at the University at Frankfurt, where he taught until his retirement in 1993. More recently, Habermas has himself taken an active role in the public sphere, entering into debates on Holocaust denial and global terrorism.

In Sex and Genealogies (1993) she writes: “Everywhere, in everything, men’s speech, men’s values, dreams, and desires are law.” Irigaray’s feminist work can be seen as a struggle to find authentically female ways of speaking and desiring that are free from male-centeredness.

"One must assume the feminine role deliberately."

Wisdom and desire

To address this problem, Irigaray suggests that all thinking—even the most apparently sober and objective-sounding philosophy, with its talk of wisdom, certainty, rectitude, and moderation—is underpinned by desire. In failing to acknowledge the desire that underpins it, traditional male-centered philosophy has also failed to acknowledge that beneath its apparent rationality simmer all manner of irrational impulses.

Irigaray suggests that each sex has its own relationship to desire, and as a result each sex has a relation to madness. This calls into question the long tradition of equating maleness with this rationality, and femaleness with irrationality. It also opens the way to the possibility of new ways of writing and thinking about philosophy, for both men and women.

## Post-colonialism

BEFORE

19th century European scholars research the histories of their colonial subjects.

1940S In the aftermath of World War II, the European colonial empires begin to fragment and collapse.

1952 Frantz Fanon writes Black Skin, White Masks, an early study of the damage caused by colonialism.

AFTER

1988 Indian philosopher Gayatri Spivak publishes Can the Subaltern Speak? examining post-colonialism.

From 2000 Scholars such as Noam Chomsky increasingly interpret American global power according to a model of imperialism.

The Palestinian writer Edward Said was one of the 20th century’s foremost critics of imperialism. In 1978 he published Orientalism, which explored how the depictions of Islamic societies by 19th-century European scholars were closely related to the imperialist ideologies of European states.

In his later work, Said remained critical of all forms of imperialism, past and present. He points out that although we may be critical of empires of the past, these empires saw themselves as bringing civilization to the world—a view not shared by the people they claimed to be helping. Empires plunder and control, while masking their abuses of power by talking about their “civilizing” missions. If this is the case, Said warns, we should be wary of present-day claims by any state undertaking foreign interventions.

The British Empire was one of many 19th-century empires that claimed to believe it was bringing the benefits of civilization to the countries it colonized, such as India.

## Feminism

BEFORE

1792 Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman initiates serious debate about the nature of the roles women are conditioned to play in society.

1807 Georg Hegel explores the dialectic between “master” and “slave” in Phenomenology of Spirit.

1949 Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex is published, rapidly becoming a key text in the French feminist movement.

AFTER

1997 In their book Fashionable Nonsense, physics professors Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont criticize Kristeva’s misuse of scientific language.

Bulgarian-born philosopher and psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva is often regarded as one of the leading voices in French feminism. Nevertheless, the question of whether, or in what way, Kristeva is a feminist thinker has been subject to considerable debate. Part of the reason for this is that for Kristeva herself, the very notion of feminism is problematic. Feminism has arisen out of the conflict women have had with the structures that are associated with male dominance or power. Because of these roots, Kristeva warns, feminism carries with it some of the same male-centered presuppositions that it is seeking to question.

If the feminist movement is to realize its goals fully, Kristeva believes that it is essential for it to be more self-critical. She warns that by seeking to fight what she calls the “power principle” of a male-dominated world, feminism is at risk of adopting yet another form of this principle. Kristeva is convinced that for any movement to be successful in achieving true emancipation, it must constantly question its relationship to power and established social systems—and, if necessary “renounce belief in its own identity.” If the feminist movement fails to take these steps, Kristeva fears that it is in serious danger of developing into little more than an additional strand in the ongoing game of power.

Margaret Thatcher, like many women who have achieved positions of great power, modified her public image to incorporate classic male concepts of strength and authority.

## Marxism

BEFORE

1807 Georg Hegel publishes The Phenomenology of the Spirit, laying the groundwork for Marxist thought.

1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels publish their Communist Manifesto.

1867 Marx publishes the first volume of Capital (Das Kapital), a treatise on political economy.

1899 In The Interpretation of Dreams, psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud claims that much of human behavior is driven by unconscious forces.

1966 Psychoanalytical theorist Jacques Lacan, one of Žižek’s major influences, revisits Freud’s ideas in Écrits.

The idea that all the best Marxist analyses have traditionally been analyses of failure appears in an interview with Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek given in 2008. In this interview, Žižek was asked about the events in Czechoslovakia in 1968, when a period of reform, aimed at decentralizing and democratizing the country, was brutally brought to an end by the Soviet Union and its allies.

Žižek’s claim is that the crushing of the reforms became the very thing that later sustained a myth held by the political left—namely that, had the reforms gone ahead, some kind of social and political paradise would have followed. According to Žižek, those on the political left are prone to dwelling on their failures, because doing so allows myths to be generated about what would have happened if they had succeeded. Žižek says that these failures allow those on the left to maintain a “safe moralistic position”, because their failures mean that they are never in power, or truly tested by action. He describes this stance as the “comfortable position of resistance”, which allows an avoidance of the real issues—such as re-evaluating the nature of political revolution. For Žižek, a dedicated Marxist, serious questions about the nature of political power are obscured by endlessly trying to justify utopia’s elusiveness.

The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 led to the end of the short-lived “Prague Spring” period of liberalization. All moves toward democracy were suppressed until 1989.
